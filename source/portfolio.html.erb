		<h3>Seth Godin Internship</h3>
		<div class="description">
			<img src="/images/krypton.png" align="right"></img>
			<p>
				From the Vimeo description:
				<blockquote>More than 3,000 people applied to be part of this paid internship, and 16 spent a fortnight together, sprinting, building, inventing, connecting and generally making a ruckus. Some of what we created sings and dances, other bits didn't quite reach the launch stage, but we all learned essential lessons about what it means to do work that matters.</blockquote>

		<p>
			Working with Professor Niki Kittur and a team of 4 others, we are developing an application that attempts to leverage other people’s knowledge. When given a problem, it generates a well-formed answer using a combination of the crowd and artificial intelligence. So instead of going through many web pages to find an answer, the application does it for you.
